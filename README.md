# SHADOW_MD_DOME_EEBEL
SHADOW Arduino Code for R2-D2 using Marcduino Control boards.  This code is used with a three Marcduino configuration.  Two are in the dome (Master and Slave) and a third is in the body (Which is setup as a Master using the Eclipse IDE.  Instructions for that are on the Curious Marc website. To get Eclipse to work, I had to install the JAVA IDE.

Follow the basic setup and wiring from the Astromech.net SHADOW and SHADOWMD WIKI pages.  If anyone has a good suggestion on how to do a proper wiring diagram, let me know and I'll add it to this repository.  Also, I'll add any other information to this site as requested.
