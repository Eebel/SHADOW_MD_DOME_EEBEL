//   Note: You will need a Arduino Mega ADK rev3 to run this sketch,
//   as a normal Arduino (Uno, Duemilanove etc.) doesn't have enough SRAM and FLASH
//
//   This is written to be a SPECIFIC Sketch - supporting only one type of controller
//      - PS3 Move Navigation + MarcDuino Dome Controller & Optional Body Panel Controller
//
//   PS3 Bluetooth library - developed by Kristian Lauszus (kristianl@tkjelectronics.com)

//   SyRen 10 Dome Drive:
//         For SyRen packetized Serial Set Switches: 1, 2 and 4 Down, All Others Up
//         NOTE:  Support for SyRen Simple Serial has been removed, due to problems.
